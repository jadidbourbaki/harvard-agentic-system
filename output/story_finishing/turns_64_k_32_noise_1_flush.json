But beware, for the treasure I possess is not without its cost.\n\nTo claim it, you must answer a question, one that only the bravest and most wise can answer.

The dragon watched as Isolde carefully cr adled the gemstone into a small pouch she had brought for the purpose. As she did so, the dragon's eyes softened even more further, a sense of peace radiating from it. \"You have shown great courage, Isolde,\" the dragon said, its voice softer now \"and wisdom beyond your years.
