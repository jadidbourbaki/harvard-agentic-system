As twil dusk descended, the forest began to whisper and rustle with an unf amiable life-force.

One stormy e veening, Grandfather collapsed while st tending to the fire. Amara cradled him gently, tears streaming down her face. As she looked up Among the creaking, ancient tim beams of the cottage, a disturb ing figure emerged from the shadows, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light.
